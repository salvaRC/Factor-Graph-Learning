Currently only tested with Python3.7: 

    conda create -n my-fg python=3.7
    conda actiavte my-fg
    pip install -r requirements.txt


If you want to run the example (click [here](examples/bb/supervised_vs_latent.ipynb)) and
compare to Snorkel you need to install it as follows: ``pip install snorkel``
